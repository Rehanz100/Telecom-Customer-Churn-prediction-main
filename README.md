# <div align="center">Telecom Customer Churn Prediction</div>

Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting customer churn for a telecom company. Customer churn refers to the loss of clients or customers, and predicting it is crucial for businesses to take preemptive measures to retain customers.

Objectives
Analyze customer data to identify patterns and factors that contribute to customer churn.
Build predictive models using machine learning techniques to accurately forecast which customers are likely to leave the service.
Provide actionable insights to help the telecom company develop strategies for reducing churn and improving customer retention.
Key Features
Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing the data to ensure accuracy and reliability for model training.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing and analyzing the dataset to uncover important trends and correlations.
Model Building: Training and evaluating multiple machine learning models to select the best-performing one for churn prediction.
Model Evaluation: Assessing the performance of the models using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Feature Importance Analysis: Identifying which features or factors have the most significant impact on customer churn.
Tools and Technologies
Programming Language: Python
Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
Machine Learning Algorithms: Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Support Vector Machines (SVM)
Data Visualization: Graphs and plots to represent data trends and model performance.
Conclusion
This project provides a comprehensive approach to predicting customer churn, enabling the telecom company to implement targeted retention strategies. The use of advanced machine learning techniques ensures accurate and reliable predictions, contributing to better decision-making and customer satisfaction.
